Principles
----------

We take privacy seriously.  We will strive to keep the amount of data stored to
the minimum required to legally run a political party.  Under no circumstances
will this data be monetised.

It will be difficult to secure any data for a party that bases itself on
decentralisation.  Bitcoin has managed to be secure but at great computational
cost.  Sounds like we need a DAO...

Should any of our data leak, we will be open about the facts.  Reporting will
be punctual.  Detailed analysis takes time though.

Processing Rules
----------------

The BitcoinParty only holds the following data centrally (per-country):

The names and contact details (email addresses, phone numbers etc but should
under no account include physical addresses) of secretaries and treasurers.
These may be passed to potential members enquiring about joining a local
grouping. (We may need a physical address for each accounting unit I'm not
sure yet.)

All donatations including
    the accounting unit taking the donation
    the name of the source, if known
    the amount of the donation, if money, or the nature and value of the
      donation if non-money
    the manner in which the donation was made
    if the donation is permissible
    the date we received the donation
    the date we accepted the donation
    the date we returned the donation
    the action we took to return the donation (for example, the person or
      institution you returned it to)

These donation details will be passed to regulators in accordance with their
rules.

Each local grouping also keeps data (which may include names, email addresses,
phone numbers but should under no account include physical addresses) to keep
track of its membership.
